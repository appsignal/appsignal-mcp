# AppSignal MCP Server [beta]

This is the official AppSignal [MCP][mcp] server. It allows AI agents to access AppSignal's monitoring data, metrics, and tools and is currently in beta.

Join our [Discord community][discord] to help test and shape this MCP implementation.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- An [AppSignal account][appsignal-sign-up] and an [AppSignal MCP token][appsignal-mcp-token].

## Installation

Pull the Docker image:

```
docker pull appsignal/mcp:latest
```

## Configuration

### Claude

Configure Claude to use the AppSignal MCP server by editing the `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "appsignal": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-e", "APPSIGNAL_API_KEY", "appsignal/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "APPSIGNAL_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude code

To enable AppSignal MCP in Claude Code, run the following command:

```
claude mcp add appsignal -e APPSIGNAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here -- docker run -i --rm -e APPSIGNAL_API_KEY appsignal/mcp
```

### Cursor and Windsurf

To enable AppSignal MCP in Cursor or Windsurf, edit your configuration file.

For Cursor use `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

For Windsurf use `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`

Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "appsignal": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-e", "APPSIGNAL_API_KEY", "appsignal/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "APPSIGNAL_API_KEY": "your-mcp-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Zed

Open your Zed settings file and add the `context_servers` section:

```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "appsignal": {
      "source": "custom",
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-e", "APPSIGNAL_API_KEY", "appsignal/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "APPSIGNAL_API_KEY": "your-mcp-token"
      }
    }
}
```

### VSCode

If you are running GitHub Copilot, and are signed in under a company account, make sure to set "MCP servers in Copilot" to "Enabled" under your organization settings > Copilot > Policies.

![GitHub Copilot Settings](public/assets/images/github-copilot-settings.png)

Then add this config to your `.vscode/mcp.json` settings:

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "appsignal_mcp_token",
      "description": "AppSignal MCP Token",
      "password": true
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "appsignal": {
      "command":  "docker"
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "APPSIGNAL_API_KEY",
        "appsignal/mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "APPSIGNAL_API_KEY": "${input:appsignal_mcp_token}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Development

To work on the MCP server:

1. Start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode:

   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```

2. Run tests:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. Use the MCP inspector for debugging:
   ```bash
   npm run inspector
   ```
