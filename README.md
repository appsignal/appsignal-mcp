## Configuration examples

### Claude

Configure Claude to use the MCP server by editing `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
(See below for Claude _code_)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "appsignal": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "-e",
          "APPSIGNAL_API_KEY",
          "appsignal/mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "APPSIGNAL_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude code

```
claude mcp add appsignal -e APPSIGNAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here -e  -- docker run -i --rm -e APPSIGNAL_API_KEY appsignal/mcp
```

### Zed

```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "appsignal": {
      "command": {
        "path": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "-e",
          "APPSIGNAL_API_KEY",
           "appsignal/mcp"
        ],
        "env": {
          "APPSIGNAL_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
        }
      },
      "settings": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## Development

To work on the MCP server:

1. Start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode:
   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```

2. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
