# AppSignal MCP Server

The AppSignal MCP Server is an implementation of the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)][mcp] that connects any with AppSignal's API. This integration allows AI agents to access AppSignal's monitoring data, metrics, and tools.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.10.0 or higher
- An [AppSignal account][appsignal-sign-up] with API access

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-mcp.git
   cd appsignal-mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Configuration examples

#### Claude

Configure Claude to use the MCP server by editing `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "appsignal": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/appsignal-mcp/build/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "APPSIGNAL_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Development

To work on the MCP server:

1. Start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode:
   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```

2. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. Use the MCP inspector for debugging:
   ```bash
   npm run inspector
   ```
